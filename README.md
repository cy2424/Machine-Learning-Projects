# Credit Card Approval Prediction App
This repository contains the code for deploying a machine learning model which predicts the approval status of a credit card application based on various input features. The app is built with Streamlit, an open-source Python library that allows you to create beautiful, interactive web apps for machine learning and data science.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether a credit card application will be approved or not. The project is structured as follows:

Data Preprocessing: We first load and preprocess the dataset, handling any missing or categorical values.
Model Training: We train a logistic regression model on the processed dataset.
Model Deployment: We use Streamlit to create a web app where users can input their own data and see the model's prediction for their data.

# App Interface
The Streamlit app provides an intuitive interface where you can input the following parameters:

Age
Debt
Married
Bank Customer
Industry
Ethnicity
Years Employed
Prior Default
Employed
Credit Score
Citizen
Zip Code
Income
Upon entering these values, the app will output a prediction of whether a credit card application with these attributes would be approved or not.
